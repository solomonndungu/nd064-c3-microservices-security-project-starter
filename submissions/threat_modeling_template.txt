4.5 Ensure Content trust for Docker is Enabled (Automated)

- Content trust provides the ability to use digital signatures for data sent to and received from remote Docker
registries. These signatures allow client-side verification of the identity and the publisher of specific image
tags and ensures the provenance of container images.

- You should execute the following command:

echo $DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST

- This should return a value of 1.


5.23 Ensure that docker exec commands are not used with the user=root option (Manual)

- If you have auditing enabled as recommended in Section 1, you can use the command below to filter out docker exec
commands that use the --user=root option.

ausearch -k docker | grep exec | grep user



5.25 Ensure that the container is restricted from acquiring additional privileges (Automated)

- The no_new_priv bit is in the kernel. It ensures that the process and its child processes do not gain any additional
privileges via suid or sgid bits. This reduces the danger associated with many operations because the possibility of
subverting privileged binaries is lessened.

- You should run the following command:

docker ps --quiet --all | xargs docker inspect --format '{{ .Id }}:
SecurityOpt={{ .HostConfig.SecurityOpt }}'
