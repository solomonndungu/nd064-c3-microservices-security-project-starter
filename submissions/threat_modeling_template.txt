4.5 Ensure Content trust for Docker is Enabled (Automated)

- Content trust provides the ability to use digital signatures for data sent to and received from remote Docker
registries. These signatures allow client-side verification of the identity and the publisher of specific image
tags and ensures the provenance of container images.

- To enable content trust in a bash shell, you should enter:

export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1

- You should execute the following command:

echo $DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST

- This should return a value of 1.


2.8 Enable user namespace support (Automated)

- 


5.25 Ensure that the container is restricted from acquiring additional privileges (Automated)

- The no_new_priv bit is in the kernel. It ensures that the process and its child processes do not gain any additional
privileges via suid or sgid bits. This reduces the danger associated with many operations because the possibility of
subverting privileged binaries is lessened.

- You should run the following command:

docker ps --quiet --all | xargs docker inspect --format '{{ .Id }}:
SecurityOpt={{ .HostConfig.SecurityOpt }}'
