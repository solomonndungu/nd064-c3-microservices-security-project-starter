4.5 Ensure Content trust for Docker is Enabled (Automated)

- Content trust provides the ability to use digital signatures for data sent to and received from remote Docker
registries. These signatures allow client-side verification of the identity and the publisher of specific image
tags and ensures the provenance of container images.

- To enable content trust in a bash shell, you should enter:

export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1

- You should execute the following command:

echo $DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST

- This should return a value of 1.


3.16 Ensure that the Docker socket file permissions are set to 660 or more restrictively (Automated)

- You should execute the command:

chmod 660 /var/run/docker.sock

- This sets the file permissions of the Docker socket file to 660.

- You should execute the command below to verify that the Docker socket file has permissions of 660 or more
restrictive permissions.

stat -c %a /var/run/docker.sock


5.14 Ensure that the 'on-failure' container restart policy is set to '5' (Automated)

- If you wish a container to be automatically restarted, a sample commandis a below:

docker run --detach --restart=on-failure:5 nginx

- If this option is set, a container will only attempt to restart itself 5 times.

- You should use the command below:

 docker ps --quiet --all | xargs docker inspect --format '{{ .Id }}: RestartPolicyName=
 {{ .HostConfig.RestartPolicy.Name }} MaximumRetryCount={{ .HostConfig.RestartPolicy.MaximumRetryCount
  }}'

- If this command returns RestartPolicyName=always, then the system is not configured optimally.

- If the above command returns RestartPolicyName=no or just RestartPolicyName=, then restart policies
are not being used and the container would never be restarted automatically. Whilst this may be a secure
option, it is not the best option from a usability standpoint.

- If the above command returns RestartPolicyName=on-failure, then verify that the number of restart attempts
is set to 5 or less by looking at MaximumRetryCount.
