1. Closely review Kube-bench findings and threat model any implications.
 - Use the Rancher Benchmark Assessment PDF and think back to your threat model to reason through the finding.
 - Pay special attention to how the risk can be realized versus just trying to address findings.

2. Create a plan on how to test the change. Really think through the implications of the change.
 - Often this needs to be closely coordinated with other teams and tested in a non-production environment.

3. Test the hardening on a non-production or staging cluster.
 - Create a non-production cluster representative of your production. Sometimes problems due to hardening steps
 do not materialize unless there is a load on the system or traffic.
 - One technique is canary testing, where we split some production traffic to the staging environment and test
 there.
 - While testing in the non-production or staging cluster, we should also closely monitor metrics for regressions,
 i.e. undesired changes or consequences from hardening.
 - Closely monitor metrics to ensure no regressions.
